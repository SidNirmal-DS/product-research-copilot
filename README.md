# Product Research Copilot

An AI-powered research copilot that converts open-ended product or market questions into structured, decision-ready reports.

The goal is simple: reduce ambiguity, surface trade-offs, and bring clarity to decision-making — not just for Product Managers, but for anyone evaluating a market, product, or business idea.

## Why this exists

In many teams, research lives in scattered documents, opinions and unstructured discussions. Decisions get delayed not because data is missing, but because thinking is fragmented.

This copilot introduces **structure first**:
- Clear sections
- Explicit assumptions
- Defined risks
- Actionable recommendations

The result is faster alignment and better decisions under real constraints.

## What the Copilot Produces

For any given research question, the system generates a structured report covering:

- Summary (high-level context)
- Key insights
- Competitors and alternatives
- User pain points
- Risks and assumptions to validate
- What not to do
- Next research questions
- Recommendations with trade-offs
- Confidence level
- Infographic specification for visual storytelling

Outputs are designed to be:
- Human-readable
- Presentation-ready
- Suitable for PDF, slides, or internal reviews

## How it Works:

The copilot follows a strict multi-step flow:

1. **Reasoning Layer**  
   Analyzes the input problem, users, market context, competitors, and adoption criteria.

2. **Collation Layer**  
   Converts analysis into a fixed, disciplined report structure with no extra noise.

3. **Sanitization Layer**  
   Removes any accidental instruction text or system artifacts, keeping only report content.

4. **Formatting Layer**  
   Converts the cleaned report into a professional, PDF-style HTML layout.

## Example Use Cases

- Market expansion analysis
- Product positioning decisions
- Competitive landscape reviews
- Early-stage business validation
- Strategy and consulting-style research summaries

## Tooling Note

This project was prototyped using **Google Opal** as an orchestration layer for prompt workflows.  
The core value lies in the **prompt design, structure and decision logic**, not in any single tool.

---

## Status

This is an experimental v1 focused on:
- Clarity
- Structure
- Decision usefulness

Future versions may integrate external data sources, APIs or dashboards.
